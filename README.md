## Text-To-Speech Converter

This is a simple app that converts text to speech.

Users simply type or copy and paste text into the input field, then select a voice from a drop down menu and click convert.
The text is then spoken by a automated voice provided by the Speech Synthesis interface from Web Speech API.
